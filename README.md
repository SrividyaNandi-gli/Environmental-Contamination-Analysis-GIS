# Environmental-Contamination-Analysis-GIS
This project is focused on mapping and analyzing environmental contamination sources, including gas stations, junkyards, dry cleaners, and UST facilities, using GIS tools. The analysis aims to identify high-density contamination areas and assess potential risks to sensitive locations like schools, hospitals, parks, and residential areas.
# Project Details
# Objectives
Visualize Contamination Sources: Map and categorize contamination sources for clear visual identification.
Identify High-Density Areas: Perform Kernel Density analysis to detect areas with concentrated contamination sources.
Proximity Analysis to Sensitive Locations: Assess the distance between contamination sources and sensitive areas to understand potential environmental impacts.
Generate Reports: Calculate summary statistics for each contamination type and generate reports summarizing findings.
# Methodology
Data Preparation: Loaded the dataset into ArcGIS Pro, categorizing contamination sources by type for structured analysis.
Spatial Visualization: Applied symbology for each contamination type to improve map readability.
Kernel Density Analysis: Used the Kernel Density tool to produce a heatmap, identifying clusters of contamination sources.
Proximity and Buffer Analysis: Measured distances between contamination sources and sensitive areas using proximity and buffer tools.
Statistical Summary: Generated statistics to report on contamination type distribution, buffer zone sizes, and density per area.
# Tools and Libraries
ArcGIS Pro: For mapping, analysis, and visualization.
Spatial Analyst Extension: Enabled Kernel Density analysis to produce heatmaps.
To perform data manipulations and generate summary statistics.
# Results
Contamination Density Map: The Kernel Density heatmap identifies areas of high contamination source concentration.
Impact Zones: Proximity and buffer analysis highlight contamination sources close to sensitive locations, providing actionable data for environmental management.
Summary Reports: Tables and charts summarize contamination source types, buffer zone sizes, and proximity details, offering insights into environmental risks in different areas.
