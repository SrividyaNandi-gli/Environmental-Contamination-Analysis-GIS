# Environmental-Contamination-Analysis-GIS
This project is focused on mapping and analyzing environmental contamination sources, including gas stations, junkyards, dry cleaners, and UST facilities, using GIS tools. The analysis aims to identify high-density contamination areas and assess potential risks to sensitive locations like schools, hospitals, parks, and residential areas.
